# MINI PROJECT ([Exercise]() 10)

We will be deploying a real life application:
- Demo Project: https://github.com/f1amy/laravel-realworld-example-app
- Setup Debian 11 on a virtual machine instance with a cloud provider or as instructed
- Setup Apache with every dependency the application needs to run
- Don't use Laravel Sail or Docker as suggested in the project README file, simple clone the project with Git and deploy with Apache
- Setup MySQL with credentials and a database for your aplication to use
- Configure a subdomain if you have a domain name to point the VM instance or speak to an instructor for further guide
- You have completed the project if you are able to view the application according to the specifications in the project from your Host browser
